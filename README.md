Applications of Computer Vision-

There are many practical applications of computer vision:

>Autonomous Vehicles — This is one of the most important applications of Computer vision where the self-driving cars need to gather information about their surroundings to decide how to behave.

>Facial Recognition — This is also a very important application of computer vision where electronics use facial recognition technology to basically validate the identity of the user.

>Image Search and Object Recognition — Now we could search objects in an image using image search. A very good example is google lens where we could search a particular object within the image by clicking the photo of the image and the computer vision algorithm will search through the catalogue of images and extract information out of the image.

>Robotics — Most robotic machines, often in manufacturing, need to see their surroundings to perform the task at hand. In manufacturing machines may be used to inspect assembly tolerances by “looking at” them.

### In this notebook we are trying train the model to recognize the world leaders just by using their images.(Facial Recognition)

### Installation:

To run this notebook interactively:

1. Download this repository in a zip file by clicking on this [link](https://github.com/Harshitdy/world-leader-image-classification/archive/refs/heads/github.zip) or execute this from the terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/Harshitdy/world-leader-image-classification.git`
2. Unzip the folder and open in your IDE.
3. navigate to the servers/server.py file.

### Haar cascade classifier
Haar Cascade Classifiers : We will implement our use case using the Haar Cascade classifier. Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001.

#### This Notebook will show basic examples of:
*  Data Collection
*  Data Preprocessing
*  Feature Extraction
*  Model Training
